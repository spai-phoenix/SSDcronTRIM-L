# Program: SSDcronTRIM
# Author:  Matthias Egger <m.egger@matse.ch>
# Purpose: intelligent cron job script which automatically
#          decides how often to trim one or more SSD partitions.
# History:
#          1.07 - 2019-05-10 - Added Crypt LUKS partition support.
#	   1.06 - 2017-07-24 - Using chmod --reference seemed to be a good
#                              quick fix. But when it comes to "renew" the
#                              cronjobs it took itself (with 600 perms) as
#                              reference. Therefore we hardcode now the 740 
#                              permissions which should finally fix all
#                              permission problems. Also corrected a typo.
#          1.05 - 2016-06-08 - Adding mktemp in the last version led to
#                              cronjobs with 0600 permissions. Therefore
#                              they were never executed :-( Thanks to
#                              Christian Dysthe for bringing it to my
#                              attention!
#          1.04 - 2016-02-26 - Multiple changes made:
#                              * Insecure usage of temporary files changed.
#                                Thanks to carnil for pointing that out!
#                              * Added History of changes into the script.
#                              * find_tool function errors did not exit the
#                                program and instead led to strange outputs.
#          1.03 - 2015-05-03 - Bumping the version check so it captures
#                              Kernels 3.0+ 
#          1.02 - 2014-03-28 - Typo prevented Trimming between 50% and 59%
#                              Usage. Thanks goes to Diego Coste.
#          1.01 - 2014-03-21 - Missed whitespaces while checking the
#                              partition usage. Found by mastropos.

# This script assumes by default that only your root partition '/' is on an
# SSD. You can add more SSD mount points, separated by spaces. Make sure
# all mount points are within the quotes. For example:
# SSD_MOUNT_POINTS="/ /home /media/my_other_ssd"
SSD_MOUNT_POINTS="/"

# This script will by default generate a man page and install it into your
# man page folder. Even if that does not interfere with your distribution,
# you might dislike this behaviour. In that case set MAN_PAGE_INSTALL to
# false to prevent an installation. By the way, the manual can be viewed
# with: man SSDcronTRIM
MAN_PAGE_INSTALL="true"

# By default this script checks with the hdparm program if the given mount
# point does support trimming. If this system has no hdparm program
# installed, if you can't or don't want to install hdparm at all AND if
# you still know the given partitions support trimming, then you can set
# HDPARM_CHECKS to false.

# has a cron daemon running. If not, define a folder here.

`$BASENAME $0` is an intelligent cronjob which, depending on the usage of
your SSD Disk(s), automatically decides how often the SSD(s) should be trimmed.
The more data you have on your SSD(s) the more often they will be trimmed.

It is intended as a fire and forget app which, once installed, does everything
fully automated. In fact it is so clever, you should be able to install it on
any linux system without using the package manager of your distribution. Just
open this script with your favorite text editor, add the partition(s) which
should be trimmed (as a space separated list into the SSD_MOUNT_POINTS
variable) and then execute `$BASENAME $0` without any option.

Beside the needed cron job(s) it also creates a man page on the fly. Both, the
cron job(s) and manual page installation does not interfere with your existing
distribution. And if you want to get rid of this script just start it with the
deinstall option and it will remove any cron job(s) and the man page.

SSDcronTRIM \- Intelligent SSD cron job which decides when to TRIM

[\fIOPTION\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
SSDcronTRIM is an intelligent cronjob which, depending on the usage of
your SSD Disk(s), automatically decides how often the SSD(s) should be trimmed.
The more data you have on your SSD(s) the more often they will be trimmed. The
trim ratio is defined as follows:
.PP
.BD -literal
 \.\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\.\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\.

.ED
.PP
SSDcronTRIM is intended as a \fIfire and forget\fR app which, once installed, does
everything fully automated. In fact it is so clever, you should be able to
install it on any linux system without using the package manager of your
distribution.
.PP
Just open the SSDcronTRIM script with your favorite text editor, add the
partition(s) which should be trimmed (as a space separated list into the
SSD_MOUNT_POINTS variable) and then execute SSDcronTRIM without any option.
.PP
To trimm a partition SSDcronTRIM uses the \fBfstrim\fR command, which should
be installed on any modern system, since it is part of the \fButil\-linux\fR
package.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
SSDcronTRIM does not need any option to work. Just start it once and it will
install itself as one or more cronjob(s) (depending on how many SSD partitions
have to be trimmed). Nevertheless it understands the following options.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-deinstall\fR
Use the deinstall option to remove all cron jobs which have been created by
SSDcronTRIM and to delete this man page. This is something like a self
desctruction option. If you have not created a backup of SSDcronTRIM you have
to re-download and re-add your settings again.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show a summary of this man page.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
print the version of SSDcronTRIM and exit
